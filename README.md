## About My Online Presence

I first encountered social media in 2009 with Facebook. After realizing how time-consuming and unnecessary it was, I decided to remove my account in 2013 during my second year at university. Since then, I have intentionally avoided social media platforms, with LinkedIn being the sole exception for professional purposes.

However, in recent years, I've found LinkedIn has shifted from its core mission as a professional networking platform toward promoting entertainment-focused content. This shift prompted me to create this independent online profile as an alternative to third-party platforms, allowing me to maintain a focused professional presence that better aligns with my values and goals.
